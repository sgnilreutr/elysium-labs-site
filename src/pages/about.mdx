# About Elysium Labs

Elysium Labs started as an open-source organization that aims to solve everyday productivity problems with powerful and easy-to-grasp software.
The goal is to have as many volunteering developers as possible working on the solutions we provide. Ideally, giving them, and you, the best experience possible within the aspect the application covers.
