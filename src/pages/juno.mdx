## Why it is built

The application is built as open-source to enable developers, project managers, and other people to go through their list of emails in the most efficient way possible.

<br />
The system is based on the core principles of the Tempo Email client, consider the
project an hommage - unfortunately, the Tempo project is no longer actively developed.

## What to solve

The goal of Juno is to spend as little time as possible in the mailbox.

<br />
A clear list of to-dos will serve as a focus for your email processing. Going through
the list of to-do or inbox items should be easy for both regular users and power
users
<br />
'Files sent via email are considered as valuable as the email text, both the text
and files should never be lost and presented clearly.'

## The development

The goal of Juno is to spend as little time as possible in the mailbox.
