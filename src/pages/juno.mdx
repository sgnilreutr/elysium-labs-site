## Why we build it

The application is built as open-source to enable developers, project managers, and other people to go through their list of emails in the most efficient way possible.

<br />
The system is based on the core principles of the Tempo Email client, consider the
project an hommage - unfortunately, the Tempo project is no longer actively developed.

## What we solve


The goal of Juno is to spend as little time as possible in the mailbox.

<br />
A clear list of to-dos will serve as a focus for your email processing. Going through
the list of to-do or inbox items should be easy for both regular users and power
users
<br />
Files sent via email are considered as valuable as the email text, both the text
and files should never be lost and presented clearly.

## Development

Juno is developed as an open-source application. All the [source code](https://github.com/Elysium-Labs-EU/juno-core/tree/main) is open and available to be read by anyone. You can start contributing right away, follow the instructions on the [README.md](https://github.com/Elysium-Labs-EU/juno-core/tree/main#readme) file on the source code.

<br />
On its turn Juno is applying the great work of other people who create the dependencies
to make it all run smoothly. The current version of Juno contains these dependencies.
