## Tech stack

The used tech stack for the projects is as of writing focused around [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [MUI (formerly known as Material UI)](https://mui.com/).

<br />
We apply different building tools based on the application's situation, such as Vite
or just ESBuild. The applications also have additional complementary dependecies
giving the application's requirements.

If you wish to improve your skills with these technologies and join a growing community of developers - don't hesitate and join the [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-pfs5354/shared_invite/zt-1dnnwr9wn-njkaaxES_sUWywV2~JANjg) now.
