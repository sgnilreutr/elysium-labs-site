# Principals

At Elysium Labs we aim to make software according to our core principals.

<br />

## Powerful

Producing software capable of doing what most people require, with a fine - grained level of control over the data.If you as a user find something lacking, reach out to us.

<br />

## Easy - to - grasp

Call it a no - brainer or intuitive, the goal of the software design is to be understandable for everyone with minimal effort.This is achieved via effective graphical designs and a fine balance of possible options to use.

<br />

## Open - source

Open - source means that anyone can see the source code of the application.And it is the case of Juno, also to contribute to it.You can contribute by adding or updating code, or by simply voicing your thoughts on the latest version of Juno.
